# Data Preprocessing and Model Evaluation Notebook

This notebook provides a complete pipeline for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation. The following topics are covered:

## 1. Handle Missing Values
Missing values can significantly affect model performance. We handle missing values using imputation techniques such as:
- **Mean/Median/Mode Imputation**: Replace missing values with the central tendency.
- **Forward/Backward Filling**: For time series data.
- **Dropping Missing Values**: If the missing data is too significant to be imputed.

## 2. Remove Redundant Features
Redundant features are removed to prevent overfitting and reduce model complexity:
- **Variance Threshold**: Remove low-variance features that add little information.
- **Domain Knowledge**: Based on insights into the dataset.

## 3. Handle Correlation Between Features
Highly correlated features can affect model performance. We identify and handle these using:
- **Correlation Matrix (Heatmap)**: Visualize feature correlations.
- **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**: Identify multicollinearity and remove highly correlated features.

## 4. Handle Outliers
Outliers can skew models, especially linear models. They are handled using:
- **Z-Score/Standard Deviation**: Remove data points beyond a threshold.
- **IQR (Interquartile Range)**: Remove data points outside of the acceptable range.
- **Domain Knowledge**: Manual removal of data points known to be outliers.

## 5. Handle Skewness in Features
Skewed features can affect the performance of linear models:
- **Log/Box-Cox Transformation**: Normalize skewed distributions.
- **Square Root/Cube Root Transformation**: For mild skewness.

## 6. Discover Features that Follow Normal Distribution
We assess whether features follow a normal distribution using:
- **QQ-Plot**: Visual tool for checking normality.
- **Shapiro-Wilk Test**: Statistical test to check normality.

## 7. Split Data Before Any Transformation
To prevent data leakage, it is critical to split the data into training and testing sets before performing any transformations:
- **Training Set**: Used to fit the model.
- **Testing Set**: Used to evaluate model performance.

## 8. Feature Scaling
Some models require scaled data for better performance:
- **Standardization (Z-Score Normalization)**: Transform features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- **Min-Max Scaling**: Scale features to a range (usually 0 to 1).

## 9. Encoding Categorical Features
Categorical variables are transformed into numeric formats:
- **One-Hot Encoding**: For nominal categorical variables.
- **Label Encoding**: For ordinal categorical variables.
- **Target Encoding**: Sometimes useful for high-cardinality categorical features.

## 10. Handle Multicollinearity
To reduce the effect of multicollinearity between features:
- **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**: Identify and remove multicollinear features.

## 11. How to Evaluate Models
We evaluate models using multiple metrics to ensure robust performance:
- **RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination)**: Measures how well the model explains the variance in the data.
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Measures average squared difference between observed and predicted values.
- **Cross-Validation**: k-fold cross-validation to ensure model generalization.

## 12. Linear Regression
Linear regression is used to establish a linear relationship between features and target:
- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**: To minimize the sum of squared residuals.
- **Regularization**: Apply Lasso or Ridge regression to prevent overfitting.

## 13. Feature Selection by Backward Elimination
We implement feature selection to enhance model performance:
- **Backward Elimination**: Start with all features and remove the least significant features iteratively based on p-values.

## 14. Try Many Different Models
Different models are trained to find the best-performing one:
- **Linear Models**: Linear regression, Lasso, Ridge.
- **Tree-Based Models**: Decision trees, Random forests, Gradient boosting.
- **Support Vector Machines**: For classification and regression tasks.

## 15. Hyperparameters Tuning
We optimize model performance by tuning hyperparameters:
- **Grid Search/Random Search**: Systematically search for the best parameters.
- **Cross-Validation**: Ensure that the model generalizes well.
